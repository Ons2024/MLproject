# End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project, covering all stages from data collection to model deployment.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Describe the problem your model solves.
- **Dataset:** Briefly mention the dataset used (source, size, features).
- **Tech Stack:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, etc.

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering and preprocessing data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding data patterns and insights.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating and selecting relevant features.
4. **Model Building:** Training and evaluating machine learning models.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics.
6. **Deployment:** Deploying the model for real-world use.
